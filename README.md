## NYU DS-3001 Machine Learning Project.
Topic: Image_synthesis with DCGAN,WGAN,Relaxed WGAN
Collaborator: Lifan Wang, Guanhua Chen, Kuan Chen  

## Instruction
This project aimed to use cifar10, mnist, customized dataset to generate new images
You can just load the *.ipython file within each folder and reproduce the result. 

## Datasets
We built our PG-GAN model from MINST, CIFAR-10, Unknown dataset.   

## Results
The network would generate fake images during the training process, they are stored in the folders.
